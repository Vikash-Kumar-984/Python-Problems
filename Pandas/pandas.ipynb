       "  'body': '### Pandas version checks\\n\\n- [x] I have checked that the issue still exists on the latest versions of the docs on `main` [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/)\\n\\n\\n### Location of the documentation\\n\\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.mask.html#pandas.Series.mask\\n\\nSimilar issues exist for DataFrame.mask, Series.where, and DataFrame.where; they appear to use the same docstring with replacements.\\n\\n### Documentation problem\\n\\nIn this passage:\\n\\n>The mask method is an application of the if-then idiom. For each element in the calling DataFrame, if `cond` is `False` the element is used; otherwise the corresponding element from the DataFrame `other` is used. **If the axis of `other` does not align with axis of `cond` Series/DataFrame, the misaligned index positions will be filled with True.**\\n\\nThe bolded sentence is not correct. Here is an example where the `other` value is not aligned to `cond`, because the d value in `cond` has no match in `other`. However, `cond` is still not filled with True.\\n\\n```\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\na = pd.Series([\\'apple\\', \\'banana\\', \\'cherry\\', \\'dango\\'], index=[\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\'])\\nb = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4], index=[\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\'])\\n\\nother = pd.Series([\\'asparagus\\', \\'broccoli\\', \\'carrot\\', \\'dill\\'], index=[\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'D\\'])\\ncond = b.lt(3)\\n\\nprint(\"Cond matches other?\", cond.index == other.index)\\nprint(\"Cond matches self?\", cond.index == a.index)\\n\\na.mask(cond, other)\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```\\nCond matches other? [ True  True  True False]\\nCond matches self? [ True  True  True  True]\\n\\na    asparagus\\nb     broccoli\\nc       cherry\\nd        dango\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, you can see that even though cond\\'s d index has no corresponding aligned element in other, it still does not make a replacement for item d - not even to replace it with an NA value.\\n\\nRather, the alignment is done between `self` and `cond`, not `other` and `cond`.\\n\\n### Suggested fix for documentation\\n\\nProposed fix:\\n\\n>The mask method is an application of the if-then idiom. For each element in the calling DataFrame, if `cond` is `False` the element is used; otherwise the corresponding element from the DataFrame `other` is used. If the axis of **`self`** does not align with axis of `cond` Series/DataFrame, the misaligned index positions will be filled with True.\\n\\nHere is an example which shows that this is correct. In the following code, `cond` and `self` are not aligned. The unaligned value in `cond` is treated as True.\\n\\n```\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\na = pd.Series([\\'apple\\', \\'banana\\', \\'cherry\\', \\'dango\\'], index=[\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\'])\\nb = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4], index=[\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'D\\'])\\n\\nother = pd.Series([\\'asparagus\\', \\'broccoli\\', \\'carrot\\', \\'dill\\'], index=[\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\'])\\ncond = b.lt(3)\\n\\nprint(\"Cond matches other?\", cond.index == other.index)\\nprint(\"Cond matches self?\", cond.index == a.index)\\n\\na.mask(cond, other)\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```\\nCond matches other? [ True  True  True False]\\nCond matches self? [ True  True  True False]\\n\\na    asparagus\\nb     broccoli\\nc       cherry\\nd         dill\\ndtype: object\\n```\\n',\n",

Pickled objects containing StringDtype columns pickled in earlier versions, including 2.2.3, may initially appear to unpickle successfully. However, listing the dtypes or even implicitly checking the dtypes by doing an operation, raises an AttributeError.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nThe documentation at read_pickle indicates backward compatibility to version 0.20.3, so a pickle from 2.2.3 should be readable and usable in 2.3.0.\\n\\nA current workaround is something like this, to wrap the object in a freshly created 2.3.0-compatible dtype:\\n\\n```\\ndef unpickle_wrap(fn):\\n   df = pd.read_pickle(fn)\\n   for col, dtype in df.dtypes.items():\\n       if pd.api.types.is_string_dtype(dtype):\\n           df[col] = df[col].astype(object).astype('string')\\n   return df\\n```\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nIn [55]: pd.show_versions()\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 2cc37625532045f4ac55b27176454bbbc9baf213\\npython                : 3.11.12\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Windows\\nOS-release            : 10\\nVersion               : 10.0.19045\\nmachine               : AMD64\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 158 Stepping 10, GenuineIntel\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : None\\nLOCALE                : English_United States.1252\\n\\npandas                : 2.3.0\\nnumpy                 : 2.2.6\\npytz                  : 2025.2\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 25.1.1\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : 9.3.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : 4.13.4\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : 1.5.0\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : 2025.5.1\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.6\\nlxml.etree            : 5.4.0\\nmatplotlib            : 3.10.3\\nnumba                 : 0.61.2+0.g1e70d8ceb.dirty\\nnumexpr               : 2.10.2\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.5\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : 19.0.1\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : 8.4.1\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : 2025.5.1\\nscipy                 : 1.15.2\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.41\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\nxarray                : 2025.6.1\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : 3.2.5\\nzstandard             : 0.23.0\\ntzdata                : 2025.2\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n(Edit: fixed example to make copy-pastable, and confirmed on main)\",\n",

This happens because `pd.NA` and `np.nan` are treated as different values even though they represent the same missing value.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Solution\\r\\nModified `assert_frame_equal` in `pandas/_testing/asserters.py` to normalize `pd.NA` and `np.nan` values when `check_dtype=False` is specified. This ensures that DataFrames with equivalent missing values but different dtypes can be compared successfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Changes Made\\r\\n- Added normalization logic in `assert_frame_equal` function to handle `pd.NA` and `np.nan` equivalence when `check_dtype=False`\\r\\n- Added comprehensive unit test in `pandas/tests/util/test_assert_frame_equal.py` to verify the fix\\r\\n\\r\\n## Testing\\r\\n- Added unit test `test_assert_frame_equal_pd_na_dtype_difference` that reproduces the original issue and verifies the fix\\r\\n- Test passes successfully with the implemented solution',\n",

Nothing looks logical to me. So I am sorry, I will make one ticket for everything, cause it would be to long to make one for each problem. Fill free to divide it in several task.\\n\\nExpected colums dtypes look quite easy to guess to me\\xa0: the user used quotemarks on `field1` to force a string type. Fields 2-4 are expected to be integers. It could be almost understandable if `field2` was converted to a float because np.int dtype doesn’t manage NA values. But Pandas has a integer type which does. So there is no reason. `Field5` should be string containing text between quotemarks. Field 6 and 7 are expected to be float. Let see what happen\\n\\nFirst try\\xa0: `df = pd.read_csv(\"exemple.csv\")`\\n\\n* Columns names quotemarks are removed, but trailing space are keeped. That’s quite surprising as there is no logic\\xa0:\\u202fOr you consider quotemarks are text delimiters and should be removed, but in this case, why to keep characters outside the delimiters\\u202f? Or you consider a everything is part of the string and in this case you must keep everything.\\n* dtypes are problematic:\\n    - `field1` have been implicitly converted to `int64`. The user explicitly asked for a `str`. The convention “what is between quotemarks is a string” is common to R, C++ and Python and wide spread. Why to not respect it\\n    - `field2` is converted to a string. Missing values are a common case to handle. I would understand a conversion to float, or an error raised. But why a conversion to a string ?\\n    - `field5` have the same problem than column names.\\n    - `field7` is converted to a string. Here it is not understandable at all as np.float handle NA values.\\n    - Other field are correct. Which is also a little surprising. So initials and trailing spaces pose problem in string fields and empty fields, but not in number field\\u202f?\\n\\n\\nCase\\xa0: `df = pd.read_csv(\"exemple.csv\", sep=r\"\\\\s*,\\\\s*\", engine=\"python\")`\\n\\nHere init and trailing spaces are removed, but not quotemarks. This ticket is probably already opened somewhere. Field types are ok, excepted for `field2`, which should be `Int32`.\\n\\n\\nCase\\xa0: `df = pd.read_csv(\"exemple.csv\", quoting=2)`\\n\\nHere I tried to explicitly tel the methods that quotemarks means string. Nonetheless it doesn’t work. But integer field are now floats. Excepted for `field2` and `field7` which are… strings\\u202f!\\n\\n\\nCase\\xa0: `df = pd.read_csv(\"exemple.csv\", quoting=3)`\\n\\nHere, the parsing of column names and string fields is wrong, but at least logical. It just keep everything.\\nFields containing NA values are still converted to string.\\n\\n\\nCase : `df = pd.read_csv(\"exemple.csv\", quoting=2, dtype={\"field1 \": \"object\",\\n                                                  \"field2 \": \"Int32\",  # fail\\n                                                  \"field3 \": \"int\",\\n                                                  \"field4 \": \"int\",\\n                                                  \"field5      \": \"object\",\\n                                                  \"field6 \": \"float\",\\n                                                  \"field7\": \"float\"  # fail\\n                                                  })`\\n\\nRaise errors and doesn’t handle fields names correctly.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nNo implicit conversion. Never.\\n\\nFor string field\\xa0: I understand I may have to tweak the `quoting` and `quotechar` parameters, but once done, everything between quotemark should be string, not int or float, and white spaces outside should be ignored.\\n\\nFor float fields containing NA values\\xa0: should be float field with NA values.\\n\\nFor int field containing NA values\\xa0: ideally should be parsed as pandas `IntXX` which handle NA values. At minimum as a np.float. But never a string.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 2cc37625532045f4ac55b27176454bbbc9baf213\\npython                : 3.13.3\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Linux\\nOS-release            : 6.12.34-1-MANJARO\\nVersion               : #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:49:06 +0000\\nmachine               : x86_64\\nprocessor             : \\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : fr_FR.UTF-8\\nLOCALE                : fr_FR.UTF-8\\n\\npandas                : 2.3.0\\nnumpy                 : 2.3.1\\npytz                  : 2025.2\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 25.0.1\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : 9.3.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : 4.13.3\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : None\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.6\\nlxml.etree            : 5.4.0\\nmatplotlib            : 3.10.3\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : None\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : 2.9.10\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : None\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : 8.4.1\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : 1.15.3\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : 0.23.0\\ntzdata                : 2025.2\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n</details>\\n',\n",

       "  'body': 'It isn\\'t 100% obvious that the new repr for Categoricals is an improvement, but it\\'s non-crazy.  One of the remaining xfails one is for `eval(repr(categorical_index))` round-tripping that won\\'t be fixable unless we revert back to the old repr behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m pretty sure that the fix in test_astype_dt64_to_string is correct and the test is just wrong, but merits a close look.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat leaves 12 xfails, including the one un-fixable round-trip one that we\\'ll just remove.  Of those...\\r\\n- [x] test_join_on_key i think is surfacing an unrelated bug that I\\'ll take a look at (xref #61771)\\r\\n- [x] test_to_dict_of_blocks_item_cache is failing because we don\\'t make series.values read-only for ArrowStringArray.  I think @mroeschke can comment on how viable/important that is.\\r\\n- [ ] test_string_categorical_index_repr is about CategoricalIndex repr that span multiple lines; with the StringDtype the padding is changed.\\r\\n- [x] 4 in pandas/tests/io/json/test_pandas.py that im hoping @WillAyd can take point on \\r\\n- [ ] test_to_string_index_with_nan theres a MultiIndex level that reprs with a `nan` instead of `NaN`.  Not a huge deal but having mixed-and-matched nans/NaNs in the repr is weird.\\r\\n- [ ] test_from_records_sequencelike i don\\'t have a good read on\\r\\n- [x] tests.base.test_misc::test_memory_usage is skipped instead of xfailed, but the reason says that it \"doesn\\'t work properly\" for arrow strings which seems xfail-adjacent.  Instead of skipping can we update the expected behavior cc @jorisvandenbossche ?\\r\\n\\r\\n(Update: looks like I missed one in test_http_headers and another in test_fsspec)',\n",
